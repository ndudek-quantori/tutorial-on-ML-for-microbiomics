# Best practices for machine learning in microbiomics

This repository contains python implementations (tested on version 3.7.6) supporting the tutorial described in:

Dudek, N.K., Chakhvadze, M., Kobakhidze, S., Kantidze, O., Gankin, Y. Best practices for supervised machine learning in microbiomics. In prep for submission (2023).

In this tutorial, we develop a machine learning (ML) classifier that can predict whether an individual has schizophrenia based on the composition of their fecal microbiota. Data was sourced from Zhu, Feng, et al. "Metagenome-wide association of gut microbiome features for schizophrenia." Nature communications 11.1 (2020): 1612.
